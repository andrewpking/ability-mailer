# Ability Mailer FAQ

Hello Ability members. I have created an HTML email template. Hopefully this tool is effective enough that it is in continued use long after I am gone.

## How to Use

1. Fork this repository into your local github branch.

1. [Clone this forked repository to your local computer using VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_cloning-a-repository).

1. [Make a new branch with the title of the email to be sent using VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_branches-and-tags).

1. From there edit the body as a normal HTML Document, please try to preserve inline styling.

1. Be sure to use a tool that generates HTML code for images such as [this one](https://html.imageonline.co/) and do not try embedding images using any other method.

1. Use the [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) app to send an HTML Email using this [guide](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-send-html-email-3468764)

1. Test the email by sending it to yourself and make sure the email looks as expected when sent through Gmail.

1. When ready, forward the email to your CSE email account and then forward it again to the desired people.

## Troubleshooting

* If the email is not rendering properly, check the [Gmail CSS guidelines](https://developers.google.com/gmail/design/css).
